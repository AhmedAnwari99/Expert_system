    "This is a system devised for a dental camp that was hosted in a village where there was no dental set up available. The camp aimed to diagnose and treat oral health problems in the population of the village. Since there was no established dental set up we anticipated a large number of patients to show up. We were a group of 5 dentists, and three helpers, one of whom was in charge of noting down the symptoms/ complaints of the patients. The symptoms entered into the expert system defined which of the 5 dentists the patient was going to be referred to. Out of the 5 dentists, one was a dental prosthetic specialist (prosthodontist), one was a gums specialist (periodontist), one was an oral surgeon, and one was an endodontist. The fifth one was a general dentist. \n",
    "\n",
    "Patients with a problem related to a particular specialty were referred to that specialist throught he use of this expert system. Patients whose symptoms were vague and difficult to establish a diagnosis on were referred to the general dentist for evaluation. This system helped manage patient traffic without them forming long lines to first get a referral and then get into another line to be treated by the specialist. "
